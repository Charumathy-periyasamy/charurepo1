1. What is boilerplate code -- Boilerplate is a term used to describe code that is repeated in many parts of an application with little alteration. 
2.   For example, the Getter/Setter in the JavaBean model class is a boilerplate code. We can reduce such boilerplate code by using the @Getter/@Setter annotation of Lombok.

eg): original code: public class User {
    private Long id;
    ...
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    ...
}


OPTIMIZED CODE:
@Getter
@Setter
public class User {
    private Long id;
    ...
}
