QUESTION: Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM.
 The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US.
 Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.
